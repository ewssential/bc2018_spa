# QuickStart on Lean Development
## A case study on how rapid prototyping with lean methods

### Scenario

**Hansehack:** defined (short) timeframe, an eager team to perform and a set goal (by team commitment).

This is one scenario, but any other scenario that fits into those constraints can be tackled with organisational methods introduced here.
E.g. organising an event (like a sports torunament), preparing for an important business presentation, prototyping, (open source) software development, ...
In short: any kind of project thats not too big for a handful of people in a reasonable timeframe.

### Goals
* Introduction to lean methods that can be easily applied to above projects.
* Understanding of what lean means (and agile)
* Understanding of Kanban

### Constraints
* **team:** 1 person is no team, but this methods can still be applied (however the gain is much smaller). The bigger the team the more disciplin is needed to perform well (even with all kinds of organisational tricks). To get warm with lean methods don't start to big (not more than eight) or to small (three at least)
* **goal:** the goal should be clearly visible. Begin with a definition of what you want to achive within the project. The team has to commit to this goal. Minor and mayor changes are allowed on the road, but the bigger the change the less likely it should be. Every change in direction (goals) eats up energy and motivation
* **time-frame:** face it: the time you are willing or able to spend on a project defines is the biggest factor determining the success and quality of your results. Plan your goals with the available time and set milestones. Most likely you will need more time to finish (or make it as shiny as you would expect it to be according to your own standards). If the time frame is clear from the beginning you can define your goals more precisely.

### Lean
**What is lean?**
There are a handfull of definitions, dozens of big expensive books and thousands of very expensive consultants that will explain you "Lean".
So in short (and probably wrong according to one or another definition): Lean is a concept/philosophy on how to organise and run a company __efficient__. Lean defines *efficient* as the reduction of *waste* in a process that generates customer value and thus money. Waste is a flaw in this process and can be any number of things: unreasonable work, transportations, waiting, overproduction, defects, ... Lean establishes a company culture, that actively explores the processes, scans for waste and introduces continous processes to reduce this waste. Lean includes all persons involved in the value generating process and especially relies on the workers mostly involved with the process. This has some implications on how a lean company should be managed, since a top-down hierarchical "i say, you do" culture contradicts lean processes.

**Why is lean so important?**
Lean applies to all kinds of companies and many big players became big because of lean thinking (Toyota). A small IT startup can use lean and a 100 year old manufacturer as well. Lean is a structural different way of structuring and organising a company, but it has it payoffs -> focus on customer value & reduction of waste.

**Lean and agile?**
Lean is a bit older than agile - some say lean methods inspired the foundation of agile and some even say: if you go agile your also going lean. And the goals of both are to a high degree identical. However agile focuses on __delivering a finished product__, while lean focuses on __reduction of waste__. This (tiny) difference leads to some operational differences.

#### Kanban
Kanban is one method that is often used within lean organisations.

**How does Kanban work?**
A board with three (sometimes more columns): Open, Work in Progress, Done
A task is placed in Open and moves from left to right. When it reaches Done it's done.
And regular meetings with the team where the content of the board and it's progress is discussed.

Sounds simple, so whats the deal here?
Easy to grasp visualisation of Open work, work in progress and Done tasks. Because of this comprehensiveness the team can easily see what it is currently doing, what they already achieved and what lies ahead of them. -> You always know where you currently stand! It also allows discussion on the task at hand - that need to be done next -> Focus.

Further capabilities: It can be used to detect bottlenecks, inefficiencies and problems. If you have 4 open tasks handled by 4 different people, that are all waiting for one specific ressource, then you have a bootleneck. One can find such cases even without Kanban, but with Kanban it becomes visible. (Imagine: daily Kanban meetings and the above scenario occures several days per week. The question: what slows you down? is answered several times with the same answer. Suddenly everybody in the team realises the limitation.)

Kanban-focus:
* manage work in progress (reduce it to a minimum)
* allow work to flow as efficient as possible
* optimize throughput

(Sidenote: Scrum focuses on tasks being Done at a given timepoint, while Kanban focuses on througput. Several blends of both are possible and applied.)
